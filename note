There are two types of events:

    - User sending data and actively provoking an event
    - Server events that may or may not be triggered by the user.
        - Like when a user Join a game, it makes non sense for the
        user to call anything like "tellImHere()"
        - But it does make sense for the server to care that
        other players need to know that the user arrived.

    - ALL the user evens needs to contain a user class, or at least,
        the user configs.
        I think it is a good idea to have the data as a class, so I can 
        add or modify stuff easier. A simple way to manipulate data in 
        the server. ( In the case it is ever needed)
